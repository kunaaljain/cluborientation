00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.060
"Everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer...

2
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.460
because it teachers you how to think."

3
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.000
>> Bill: created Microsoft

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.800
>> Jack: created Twitter

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.800
I was in sixth grade

6
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.800
I learned to code in college.

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.800
>> Ruchi: First female engineer at Facebook. 

8
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.800
I wrote a program that played Tic-tac-toe.

9
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.800
>> Drew: Created Dropbox

1
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.700
things like, What's your favorite color? Or, How old are you?

1
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.500
>> Elena: Created Clothia.com

1
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.600
>> Gabe: Created Valve

1
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.800
and say "Hello World", and I made a computer do that,

1
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
it was just astonishing.

1
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.000
>> Mark: Created Facebook

1
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.000
all of Computer Science

1
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.000
or trying to master this discipline or

1
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.000
anything like that.

1
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.000
it just started off because I wanted to do

2
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.500
this one simple thing.

2
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I want to make something that was fun for myself and and my sisters.

2
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I wrote this little program

2
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.500
then basically just add a little bit to it.

2
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Then when I needed to learn something new

2
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.500
I looked it up either in a book or on the Internet

2
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.800
and then added a little bit to it.

2
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.800
It's really not unlike kind of playing an instrument or something

2
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.500
or playing a sport.

2
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
It starts out being very intimidating,

3
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.800
but you kind of get the hang of it over time.

3
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.800
>> Chris: NBA All-Star, Coded in College

3
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.500
I know it can be intimidating...

3
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.300
a lot of things are intimidating, but...

3
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.000
you know, what isn't?

3
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.000
>> Makinde: Early Facebook engineer

3
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.500
It's more about the process of breaking down problems

3
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.900
than  coming up with

3
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
complicated algorithms as people traditionally think about it.

3
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.700
>> Vanessa: Created Girl Develop IT

4
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.500
Addition, subtraction...that's about about it.

4
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.000
>> Tony: CEO @ Zappos

4
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.400
>> Bronwen: Technical artist at Valve

4
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.500
Even if you want to become a race car driver or play baseball

4
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.500
or... you know

4
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
build a house... all of these things 

4
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
What is it, is you know, computers are everywhere.

4
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.900
You want to work in agriculture?

4
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.500
Do you want to work in entertainment? 

4
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.500
It's just all over.

5
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.500
Here we are, 2013

5
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.500
>> Will.I.Am: Created The Black Eyed Peas, Now taking coding classes

5
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.500
...information...

5
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.500
and none of us know how to read and write code.

5
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.500
When I was in school I was in the this 

5
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.500
and when people found out they laughed at me 

5
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.500
"Man I don't care! I think it's cool and I'm learning a lot and

5
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.500
some of my friends have jobs!"

5
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.500
Our policy is literally to hire as many talented engineers as we can find.

5
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.500
The whole limit in the system is that 

6
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.500
trained and have these skills today.

6
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.900
To get the very best people we try to make the office

6
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
as awesome as possible.

6
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.500
We have a fantastic chef.

6
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.500
free food

6
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.500
breakfast, lunch and dinner.

6
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.500
free laundry

6
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.500
Snacks

6
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.500
even places to play

6
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.500
video games and scooters

7
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.500
there's always kinds of interesting things

7
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.500
around the office where people can play, or relax,

7
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.500
or go to think, or play music or be creative.

7
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.500
>>HADI: Created Code.Org

7
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.500
Computer programming is an incredibly empowering skill to learn.

7
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.500
I think if someone had told me that

7
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.500
software is really about humanity, that it's really about helping people

7
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.500
by using computer technology

7
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.500
it would have changed my outlook a lot earlier.

7
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.500
To be able to actually come up with an idea and then see it in your hands and then be able to press a button

8
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.500
and have it be in millions of people hands, I mean, I think we're the first

8
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.500
generation in the world that's really ever had that kind of experience.

8
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.500
Just to think that you can start something in your college dorm room and you can have a set of people

8
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.500
who haven't built a big company before come together and build something that

8
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.500
a billion people use as part of their daily lives...

8
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.500
It's crazy to think about, right? It's really, it's humbling and it's amazing.

8
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.900
The programmers of tomorrow are the wizards of the future.

8
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.500
You know, you're going look like you have magic powers

8
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.500
It's amazing. It's, it's the closest thing we have to a super power.

8
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.600
Great coders are today's Rock Stars.  That's it!

9
00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.040
1 million of the best jobs in America may go unfilled...

9
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.280
...because only 1 in 10 schools teach students how to code.

9
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.280
Whether you want to be a doctor or a rockstar,

9
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.260
ask about a coding class at your school

9
00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.220
or learn online at Code.org
